    "- The main difference between FEM and FDM is that \n",

    "\n",
    "- As we'll see, the weak form of a PDE involves **integration** as a part of its definition.\n",
    "  - It is not a coincidence that we need fairly heavy mathematical machinery for integration and integrable functions in a general theory for FEM.\n",
    "  - For instance, modern theories for FEM assumes *Lebesgue integral*, which is more general than the Riemann integration we are familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this reason, it's natural to assume that approximate solutions we acquire with FEM are integrable functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A theory of FEM often starts from defining spaces of integrable functions like $L_{2}$, **the space of square-integrable functions**,\n",

    "    (u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} u(x)\\,v(x)dx,\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are not going to go deep into these mathematical theories. Instead, we'll try to build intuitive understanding through examples.\n",

    "  - As of 2009, a Dover edition available! \n",

    "- Other than the weak form, a working FEM further needs the following components: \n",
    "  1. Choice of basis functions (e.g., orthogonal functions, hat functions, etc), \n",
    "  2. numerical integrations in space (quadrature) and time and \n",
    "  3. efficient solvers for a large sparse linear system.\n",
