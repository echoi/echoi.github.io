## Syllabus

[Fall 2023 Syllabus](/uploads/geodynamics/CERI-7353-8353_Geodynamics_Syllabus_Fall2023.pdf)

## Course Description

This course teaches principles in continuum mechanics necessary for understanding plate tectonics and geological phenomena. Major topics include the kinematics and balance laws of continnum, stress and strain in earth's crust, bending of the elastic part of the Earth, heat transfer in the Earth by conduction and convection, the rheology of rocks, and basic mechanics of faults.


## Course Objectives

After taking this course, students will
- have confident command of the kinematics and balance laws of continuum,
- understand the governing equations for various geodynamic processes, and
- be able to tackle complex geophysical problems by finding an approximate model and derive a (semi-)analytic solution to it.

Through a term project, students will 
-build in-depth knowledge in advanced topics in geophysics and related fields and
-gain scientific communication skills.
