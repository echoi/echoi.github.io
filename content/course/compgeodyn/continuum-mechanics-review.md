<!-- {{< spoiler text="What is the difference between lists and tuples?" >}}
Lists

- Lists are mutable - they can be changed
- Slower than tuples
- Syntax: `a_list = [1, 2.0, 'Hello world']`

Tuples

- Tuples are immutable - they can't be changed
- Tuples are faster than lists
- Syntax: `a_tuple = (1, 2.0, 'Hello world')`
