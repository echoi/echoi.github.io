## Syllabus

[Spring 2024 Syllabus](/uploads/globalgeophysics/CERI7211-8211_GlobalGeophysics_Syllabus_2024.pdf)

## Course Description

This course provides an overview of the important physical characteristics of the solid earth; gravity and the figure of the earth, age of the earth and geochronology, magnetic field and paleomagnetism, plate tectonics, heat energy of the earth, and the internal structure of the earth.

## Course Objectives

After taking this course, students will have acquired knowledge on

- important physical characteristics of the planet Earth and how they were discovered and
- the physical state of the Earth’s interior that can be inferred from the observed physical properties.

A term project will provide students with training in

- scientific paper writing and
- oral scientific communication.
