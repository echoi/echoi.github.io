The 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake caused significant geodetically detectable
surface deformations across Northeast Asia, enhancing seismic activity in
the southern part of the Korean Peninsula (SKP). 

The GNSS data-based postseismic deformation rates
show variations at scales of â‰¤ 100 kilometers, generally in agreement with
regional seismicity. 

Our numerical models indicate that the asthenospheric
viscosity in this region is approximately 1019 Pa sec. However, deforma-
tion rates from the numerical models exhibit lower magnitudes and broader
scales of variation compared to those from GNSS data. The sensitivity of the
numerical modeling results suggests that small-scale variations in GNSS de-
formation rates might arise from lithospheric heterogeneity at a comparable
scale.
