title: 'Subducted seamounts are strong asperities'
weight: 30
#subtitle: ''
summary: The Daiichi-Kashima seamount subducted in the southern Japan trench is a strong asperity. Probably so are many other seamounts. Subducted seamounts functioning as a strong asperity can generate M7 earthquakes regularly (every ~20 years) and much larger tsunamigenic ones at a longer interval (100s of years).
