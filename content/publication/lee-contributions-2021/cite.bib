The Korean Peninsula (KP), located along the eastern margin of the Eurasian and Amurian plates, has experienced continual earthquakes from small to moderate magnitudes. Various models to explain these earthquakes have been proposed, but the origins of the stress responsible for this region's seismicity remain unclear and debated. This study aims to understand the stress field of this region in terms of the contributions from crustal and upper-mantle heterogeneities imaged via seismic tomography using a series of numerical simulations. A crustal seismic velocity model can determine the crustal thickness and density. Upper-mantle seismic velocity anomalies from a regional tomography model were converted to a temperature field, which can determine the structures (e.g. lithospheric thickness, subducting slabs, their gaps, and stagnant features) and density. The heterogeneities in the crustal and upper mantle governed the buoyancy forces and rheology in our models. The modelled surface topography, mantle flow stress, and orientation of maximum horizontal stress, derived from the variations in the crustal thickness, suggest that model with the lithospheric and upper-mantle heterogeneities is required to improve these modelled quantities. The model with upper-mantle thermal anomalies and east–west compression of approximately 50 MPa developed a stress field consistent with the observed seismicity in the KP. However, the modelled and observed orientations of the maximum horizontal stress agree in the western KP but they are inconsistent in the eastern KP. Our analysis, based on the modelled quantities, suggested that compressional stress and mantle heterogeneities may mainly control the seismicity in the western area. In contrast, we found a clear correlation of the relatively thin lithosphere and strong upper-mantle upwelling with the observed seismicity in the Eastern KP, but it is unclear whether stress, driven by these heterogeneities, directly affects the seismicity of the upper crust.},
