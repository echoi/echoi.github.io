abstract: Summary The Korean Peninsula (KP), located along the eastern margin of the
  Eurasian and Amurian plates, has experienced continual earthquakes from small to
  moderate magnitudes. Various models to explain these earthquakes have been proposed,
  but the origins of the stress responsible for this region's seismicity remain unclear
  and debated. This study aims to understand the stress field of this region in terms
  of the contributions from crustal and upper-mantle heterogeneities imaged via seismic
  tomography using a series of numerical simulations. A crustal seismic velocity model
  can determine the crustal thickness and density. Upper-mantle seismic velocity anomalies
  from a regional tomography model were converted to a temperature field, which can
  determine the structures (e.g. lithospheric thickness, subducting slabs, their gaps,
  and stagnant features) and density. The heterogeneities in the crustal and upper
  mantle governed the buoyancy forces and rheology in our models. The modelled surface
  topography, mantle flow stress, and orientation of maximum horizontal stress, derived
  from the variations in the crustal thickness, suggest that model with the lithospheric
  and upper-mantle heterogeneities is required to improve these modelled quantities.
  The model with upper-mantle thermal anomalies and east–west compression of approximately
  50 MPa developed a stress field consistent with the observed seismicity in the KP.
  However, the modelled and observed orientations of the maximum horizontal stress
  agree in the western KP but they are inconsistent in the eastern KP. Our analysis,
  based on the modelled quantities, suggested that compressional stress and mantle
  heterogeneities may mainly control the seismicity in the western area. In contrast,
  we found a clear correlation of the relatively thin lithosphere and strong upper-mantle
  upwelling with the observed seismicity in the Eastern KP, but it is unclear whether
  stress, driven by these heterogeneities, directly affects the seismicity of the
  upper crust.
