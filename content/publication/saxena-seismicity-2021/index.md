abstract: 'Sources of stress responsible for earthquakes occurring in the Central
  and Eastern United States (CEUS) include not only far-ﬁeld plate boundary forces
  but also various local contributions. In this study, we model stress ﬁelds due to
  heterogeneities in the upper mantle beneath the CEUS including a high-velocity feature
  identiﬁed as a lithospheric drip in a recent regional P-wave tomography study. We
  calculate velocity and stress distributions from numerical models for instantaneous
  3-D mantle ﬂow. Our models are driven by the heterogeneous density distribution
  based on a temperature ﬁeld converted from the tomography study. The temperature
  ﬁeld is utilized in a composite rheology, assumed for the numerical models. We compute
  several geodynamic quantities with our numerical models: dynamic topography, rate
  of dynamic topography, gravitational potential energy (GPE), differential stress,
  and Coulomb stress. We ﬁnd that the GPE, representative of the density anomalies
  in the lithosphere, is an important factor for understanding the seismicity of the
  CEUS. When only the upper mantle heterogeneities are included in a model, differential
  and Coulomb stress for the observed fault geometries in the CEUS seismic zones acts
  as a good indicator to predict the seismicity distribution. Our modelling results
  suggest that the upper mantle heterogeneities and structure below the CEUS have
  stress concentration effects and are likely to promote earthquake generation at
  preexisting faults in the region’s seismic zones. Our results imply that the mantle
  ﬂow due to the upper-mantle heterogeneities can cause stress perturbations, which
  could help explain the intraplate seismicity in this region.'
